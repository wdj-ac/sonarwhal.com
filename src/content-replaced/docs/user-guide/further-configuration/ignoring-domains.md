# Ignoring domains

Sometimes you donâ€™t have control over all the infrastructure and there
is nothing you can do about it. Reporting errors in those cases generates
noise and frustration. Instead of globally disabling a rule you might
want to turn it off for a domain, or directly ignore completely one (like
a third party analytics, ads, etc.). To achieve this you need to add the
`ignoredUrls` property to your `.sonarwhalrc` file:

```json
"ignoredUrls": [{
    "domain": ".*\\.domain1\\.com/.*",
    "rules": ["*"]
}, {
    "domain": "www.domain2.net",
    "rules": ["disallowed-headers"]
}]
```

Properties can be:

* regular expressions, like `.*\\.domain1\\.com/.*`. This will match:
  * `something.domain1.com/index.html`
  * `somethingelse.domain1.com/image.png`
* some text, like `www.domain2.net`. In this case, if the resource URL
  contains the text, it will be a match. E.g.:
  * `www.domain2.net/index.php`
  * `www.domain2.net/image.png`

The value of the property has to be an array of strings where the
strings can be:

* `*` if you want to ignore all rules for the given domain.
* The ID of the rule to be ignored.

In the previous example we will:

* Ignore all rules for any resource that matches the regex
  `.*\\.domain1\\.com/.*`.
* Ignore the rule `disallowed-headers` for the domain `www.domain2.net`.
