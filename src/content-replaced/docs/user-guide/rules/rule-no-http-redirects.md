# Avoid HTTP redirects in requests (`@sonarwhal/rule-no-http-redirects`)

`no-http-redirects` checks if there are any HTTP redirects in the page
`sonarwhal` is analyzing.

## Why is this important?

Consider the following simplified desription of what happens when a
user requests a URL within a browser:

1. DNS Lookup: Translate the server domain to an IP. If the browser
   doesn’t know it, it asks a DNS server which in some cases involves
   multiple queries until the final IP is obtained.
1. Open a [TCP connection][wikipedia-tcp-establishment] to the server
   IP address requesting the URL.
1. The server responds to that request by sending some content over
   the TCP connection.
   If the resource uses SSL, then [TLS negotation(s)][wikipedia-tls-handshake]
   happens as well.

When a redirect occurs, `3.` contains the new URL the browser needs to
request, repeating the whole sequence of steps. DNS Lookup isn’t cheap,
neither is [creating a TCP connection][tcp-connection-diagram]. The
impact of redirects is felt even more by mobile users, where the [network
latency is usually higher][pagespeed-insights].
As a rule of thumb, the more you can avoid redirects the better.

## How to use this rule?

To use it you will have to install it via `npm`:

```bash
npm install @sonarwhal/rule-no-http-redirects
```

Note: You can make `npm` install it as a `devDependency` using the `--save-dev`
parameter, or to install it globally, you can use the `-g` parameter. For
other options see
[`npm`'s documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install).

And then activate it via the [`.sonarwhalrc`][sonarwhalrc]
configuration file:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "parsers": [...],
    "rules": {
        "no-http-redirects": "error"
    },
    ...
}
```

## What does the rule check?

This rule checks:

* If the target URL passed to `sonarwhal` has any redirect. E.g.:
  `http://www.example.com` --> `http://example.com`
* If any resource in the page has any redirect. E.g.:
  `http://example.com/script.js` --> `https://example.com/script.js`

and alerts if at least one is found.

### Examples that **trigger** the rule

* Any URL passed to `sonarwhal` that redirects to another one
* Any page with a resource (script, css, image) behind a redirect

### Examples that **pass** the rule

* No redirect for resources nor the target URL.

## Can the rule be configured?

By default no redirects are allowed but you can change this behavior.

The following rule configuration used in the [`.sonarwhalrc`][sonarwhalrc]
file will allow 3 redirects for resources and 1 for the main URL:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "rules": {
        "no-http-redirects": ["error", {
            "max-resource-redirects": 3,
            "max-html-redirects": 1
        }],
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```
