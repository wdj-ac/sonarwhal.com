# Accessibility assessment with aXe (`@sonarwhal/rule-axe`)

`aXe` is the accessibility engine for automated testing of HTML-based
user interfaces. This rules performs the default accessibility tests
(WCAG 2.0 Level A and Level AA rules) and alerts if something fails.

## Why is this important?

> The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects
of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care,
recreation, and more. It is essential that the Web be accessible
in order to provide **equal access** and **equal opportunity** to
people with disabilities. An accessible Web can also help people
with disabilities more actively participate in society.
>
> The Web offers the possibility of **unprecedented access to
information and interaction** for many people with disabilities.
That is, the accessibility barriers to print, audio, and visual
media can be much more easily overcome through Web technologies.
>
> The document ["Social Factors in Developing a Web Accessibility
Business Case for Your Organization"][wai soc] discusses how the
Web impacts the lives of people with disabilities, the overlap with
digital divide issues, and Web accessibility as an aspect of corporate
social responsibility.
>
> Another important consideration for organizations is that web i
accessibility is required by laws and policies in some cases.

## How to use this rule?

To use it you will have to install it via `npm`:

```bash
npm install @sonarwhal/rule-axe
```

Note: You can make `npm` install it as a `devDependency` using the `--save-dev`
parameter, or to install it globally, you can use the `-g` parameter. For
other options see
[`npm`'s documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install).

And then activate it via the [`.sonarwhalrc`][sonarwhalrc]
configuration file:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "parsers": [...],
    "rules": {
        "axe": "error"
    },
    ...
}
```

## What does the rule check?

By default this rule runs all the [WCAG 2.0][wcag 2.0] Level A and
Level AA rules included in [axe-core][axe core] with `document` as
the target. Visit the [full list of default enabled rules][axe rules]
for more information of what they do.

## Can the rule be configured?

This rule uses [`axe.run`][axe.run] and the default values ([WCAG
2.0][wcag 2.0] Level A and Level AA rules) over the `document`.
You can modify what rules or categories are executed via an `options`
object that follows [aXe’s documentation][axe docs].

Some examples of rule configurations that you can have in the
[`.sonarwhalrc`][sonarwhalrc] file:

Run only WCAG 2.0 Level A rules:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "rules": {
        "axe": ["error", {
            "runOnly": {
                "type": "tag",
                "values": ["wcag2a"]
            }
        }],
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

Run only a specified set of rules:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "rules": {
        "axe": ["error", {
            "runOnly": {
                "type": "rule",
                "values": ["ruleId1", "ruleId2", "ruleId3" ]
            }
        }],
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

Run all enabled rules except for a list of rules:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "rules": {
        "axe": ["error",{
            "rules": {
                "color-contrast": { "enabled": false },
                "valid-lang": { "enabled": false }
            }
        }],
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```
