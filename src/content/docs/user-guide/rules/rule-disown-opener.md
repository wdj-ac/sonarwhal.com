# Require external links to disown opener (`@sonarwhal/rule-disown-opener`)

`disown-opener` checks if the `rel` attribute is specified with both
the `noopener` and `noreferrer` values (or only `noopener` if all the
[targeted browsers](../index.md#browser-configuration) support it) on
`a` and `area` elements that have `target="_blank"` and link to other
origins.

## Why is this important?

Links that have `target="_blank"`, such as
`<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">` constitute:

* [a security problem][security problem]

  When using `target="_blank"` the page that was linked to gains
  access to the original page’s [`window.opener`][window.opener].
  This allows it to redirect the original page to whatever it wants,
  a technique frequently used for malicious attacks on the user.
  For example, the user could be redirected to a phishing page
  designed to look like the expected page and then asking for login
  credentials (see also: [tab nabbing][tab nabbing]).

  By adding `ref="noopener"` (and `noreferrer` for older browsers)
  the `window.opener` reference won’t be set, removing the ability
  for the page that was linked to from redirecting the original one.

* [a performance problem][performance problem]

  Most modern browsers are multi-process. However, due to the
  synchronous cross-window access the DOM allows via `window.opener`,
  in most browsers pages launched via `target="_blank"` end up in
  the same process as the origin page, and that can lead to the pages
  experiencing jank.

  In Chromium based browsers, using `ref="noopener"` (or
  [`rel="noreferrer"`][noreferrer chromium] for older versions), and
  thus, preventing the `window.opener` reference from being set, allows
  new pages to be opened in their own process.

  Edge is not affected by this.

Notes:

* Not all browsers [support][noopener support] `rel="noopener"`,
  so in order to ensure that things work as expected in as many
  browsers as possible, by default, the rule requires both the
  `noopener` and `noreferrer` values to be specified. However,
  if all the [targeted browsers](../index.md#browser-configuration)
  support `noopener`, only `noopener` will be required.

* The reason why the rule does not check the same origin links by
  default is because:

  * Security isn’t really a problem here.
  * When it comes to performance, making same origin links open in
    their own process actually works against optimizations that some
    browsers do in order to keep multiple same origin tabs within
    the same process (e.g. share the same event loop).

  Check [`Can the rule be configured?`](#can-the-rule-be-configured)
  section to see how the rule can be made to also check same origin
  links.

* [`noopener` and `noreferrer` only work for `a` and `area`
  elements][html5sec].

* In the future there may be a [CSP valueless property][csp valueless
  property] property that will prevent the `window.opener` reference
  from being set.

## How to use this rule?

To use it you will have to install it via `npm`:

```bash
npm install @sonarwhal/rule-disown-opener
```

Note: You can make `npm` install it as a `devDependency` using the `--save-dev`
parameter, or to install it globally, you can use the `-g` parameter. For
other options see
[`npm`'s documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install).

And then activate it via the [`.sonarwhalrc`][sonarwhalrc]
configuration file:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "parsers": [...],
    "rules": {
        "disown-opener": "error"
    },
    ...
}
```

## What does the rule check?

By default, the rule checks if the `rel` attribute was specified with
both the `noopener` and `noreferrer` values on `a` and `area` elements
that have `target="_blank"` and link to other origins.

If the [targeted browsers are specified](#can-the-rule-be-configured),
based on their support, the rule might only require the `noopener` value.

Let’s presume the original page is `https://example1.com`.

### Examples that **trigger** the rule

```html
<a href="http://example1.com/example.html" target="_blank">example</a>
```

```html
<a href="https://en.example1.com" target="_blank">example</a>
```

```html
<a href="//example2.com" target="_blank">example</a>
```

```html
<a href="https://example2.com" target="_blank">example</a>
```

```html
<img src="example.png" width="10" height="10" usemap="#example">
<map name="example">
    <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,5,5" href="http://example3.com/example.html" target="_blank">
</map>
```

### Examples that **pass** the rule

```html
<a href="/" target="_blank">example</a>
```

```html
<a href="example.html" target="_blank">example</a>
```

```html
<a href="https://example1.com/example.html" target="_blank">example</a>
```

```html
<a href="http://example1.com/example.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example</a>
```

```html
<a href="https://en.example1.com/example.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example</a>
```

```html
<a href="//example2.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example</a>
```

```html
<a href="https://example2.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example</a>
```

```html
<img src="example.png" width="10" height="10" usemap="#example">
<map name="example">
    <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,5,5" href="example.html" target="_blank">
</map>
```

```html
<img src="example.png" width="10" height="10" usemap="#example">
<map name="example">
    <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,5,5" href="http://example3.com/example.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
</map>
```

## Can the rule be configured?

`includeSameOriginURLs` can be used to specify that same origin URLs
should also include `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

In the [`.sonarwhalrc`][sonarwhalrc] file:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "rules": {
        "disown-opener": ["error", {
            "includeSameOriginURLs": true
        }],
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

Also, note that this rule takes into consideration the [targeted
browsers](../index.md#browser-configuration), and if all of them
support the `noopener` value, the rule won’t require the `noreferrer`
value.
